======
My name is Prabhant. I am a researcher, lecturer, and engineer with a passion for Opensource Data and AI. I started my journey as a software engineer but ended up joining a PhD position in TU Eindhoven in the Automated Machine Learning group under the supervision of [Joaquin Vanschoren](https://joaquinvanschoren.github.io/home/). Prior to starting PhD, I was a senior ML engineer in Kramp Groep(NL) and an AI engineer in the OpenML project. I am associated with NUMFOCUS where I contribute to a working group on better OSS communities.

My current research interests are Transfer learning, Neural architecture search, Multimodel AI, and Meta-learning.
