My name is Prabhant. I am a researcher, lecturer, and engineer with a passion for open-source data and AI. I started my journey as a software engineer but ended up joining a PhD position at TU Eindhoven in the Automated Machine Learning group under the supervision of [Joaquin Vanschoren](https://joaquinvanschoren.github.io/home/). 

Before starting PhD, I was a senior ML engineer in Kramp Groep(NL) and an AI engineer in the OpenML project. I am associated with NUMFOCUS, where I contribute to a working group on better OSS communities. Throughout last few years of exploring different verticals, I decided to pursue my PhD in Transfer Learning and AutoML. I like to use different methods, but my favorites are Optimal Transport, Neural Solvers, and data complexity-based methods. 

My current research interests are Transfer learning, Neural architecture search, multimodal AI, and Meta-learning.
